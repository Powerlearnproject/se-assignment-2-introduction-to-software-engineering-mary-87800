# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:software engineering is the science of designing,developing and maintaining softwares.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): software engineering applies scientific  and mathematical principles as opposed to traditinal programming.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
phases of SDLC
1.planning and analysis: this nis where the developer evaluates the feasibility of creating the software based on the information available.
2.requirement definition: this involves converting the information gathered into key software3 requirement thus guiding the user to what is expected.
3. design: this involves coming up with a template for creating the software
4. development: this is the coding of the software
5. testing :this entails validating the software if its functioning ass intended.
6 deployment this involves installing the softwre to the intented user.
7. maintenance: this entails looking for errors and bugs that might have been missed in the testing phase.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
waterfall is a system development method that follows a step wise approach in development where one phase leads to the other while agile has no predetermined sequence. Agile is preferred when developing a software for the first time as it allows for modification as the process progresses while waterfall is prefered for routines developments 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
 Requirement engineering is the process of evaluating and validating the requirements the user wants to be met in the software to be developed.
 importance of requirement engineering in software development.
 it reduces the time taken to develop the system,
  it reduces risks and  cost in software developnment

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? modularity involves breaking down the system into small components called modules. It improves on maintanance as one only goes to the specific modules that has a problem during maintanance and scalability hence saving on time and resources.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing:this involves detecting errors inthe ting parts or the units of the software.
Integration testing:entails detecting errors in the interactnig components of the software.
System testing: it entails detecting errors in the in all the components of the system at once.
Acceptance testing:this involves validating if the user requirements have been met in the developed system.
testing is important as it evaluates if the software is functioning as expected.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control system are software that track changes in code over time.
they help to preserve the history of changes in software,facilitate collaboration increased transparency and prevent data lose. examples are git,mercurial and the subversion.
Software Project Management:its the process analysing

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?.
 a project manager: aligns the project objectives with business goals, oversees the project development , manages the scope of development,etc.
 challenges 
 

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. software maintenance is the process of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with user needs.
Types of software maintenance:
adaptive maintenance: this involves modifying the software to keep /it usable in the changing environment eg while adapting a new hardware.
perfective maintenance:this is done to make the software more user friendly and efficient. it also includes adding new features to improve the overall quality.
corrective maintenance: it involves fixing the errors to restore the software full functionality.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
its help to fix bugs and improve system performance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
ethical consideration in software development include:
1.respecting user privacy, during development the user entrust the developer with  sensitive personal details that oath to be protected.
transparency: then developer oath to transparent on how the software function.
accountability: the developers oath to be ready to deal with the consequences of the software's behaviors.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ethical issues 
1. privacy concerns-this might happen as they handle sensitive user data.
2. intellectual property- this might be an issue as developers often use open source proprietaries.
